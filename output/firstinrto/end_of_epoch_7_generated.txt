The problem of learning and learning in neural networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and pattern recognition problems.
The problem of learning is a fundamental problem in many machine learning.
<oov> systems are widely used for learning and classification problems in a variety of variables.
In this paper we consider a new class of training data into a set set .
The <oov> <oov> is a fundamental problem in machine learning and pattern recognition problems.
