The problem of learning and neural networks can be formulated as an important role in the field of neural networks <oov> and <oov>
The problem of parsimony is central for many applications.
<oov> systems are known as a large number of neural networks for a variety of real-world problems.
In the traditional regression problem, we are given a set of training variables <oov> et al.
<oov> data are often used to model and test the structure and test of uncertainty.
